This is our source code for the project. Each of these scripts controls some important aspect of the game. At the top of each script,
there should be a descriptive comment telling you what that script does, and what kind of object it should be attached to in the context of
the Unity Game Engine.

These C# scripts are finalized as of May 1st, 2017
